# Vue Fetch

A playground repository to try out fetch

## Getting Started

```
yarn install

yarn serve

# In separate terminal
yarn serve:json

```

## Resources

- [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
- [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)

## Challenges

- Edit the json file to mock other resource types, like Chat Messages, Calendar Events, Recipes, Movies, Books, Users, ...
- Choose some free open apis and create Views that render the results returned from the API.
- Show a loading spinner, while the data is getting fetched
- Instead of fetching on mount, trigger the fetch when you click a button
- Show an error message if the fetch doesn't work
- Try to use a route parameter to specify what should be fetched
